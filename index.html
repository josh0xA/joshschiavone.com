        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Thanks for visiting - I'm an offsensive cyber security researcher and software developer from Toronto, Canada. This is my personal page that wraps up all of my major research projects, open source tools and publications. 
        I have many years of experience in the cyber security industry and have worked with many different organizations and companies. I have a passion for software development, cyber security, mathematics and technology in general.

            <h2><i>Espionage</i></h2>
            <h3>A Network Packet and Traffic Interceptor For Linux. Spoof ARP & Wiretap A Network.</h3>
            <p>Espionage is a network packet sniffer that intercepts large amounts of data being passed through an interface. 
                The tool allows users to to run normal and verbose traffic analysis that shows a live feed of traffic, revealing packet direction, protocols, 
                flags, etc. Espionage can also spoof ARP so, all data sent by the target gets redirected through the attacker (MiTM). Espionage supports IPv4, 
                TCP/UDP, ICMP, and HTTP.</p>

            <h2><i>K55</i></h2>
            <h3>Linux x86_64 Process Injection Utility | Manipulate Processes With Customized Payloads.</h3>
            <p>The K55 payload injection tool is used for injecting x86_64 shellcode payloads into running processes. The utility was developed using modern C++11 techniques as well as some traditional C linux functions like ptrace().
            The shellcode spawned in the target process is 27 bytes and it executes /bin/sh (spawns a bash shell) within the target's address space.</p>

            <h3>Search The Deep Web Straight From Your Terminal.</h3>
            <p>Darkdump is a simple script written in Python3.11 in which it allows users to enter a search term (query) 
                in the command line and darkdump will pull all the deep web sites relating to that query. </p>

            <h2><i>Scylla</i></h2>
            <h3>The Simplistic Information Gathering Engine | Find Advanced Information on a Username, Website, Phone Number, etc. [Deprecated]</h3>
            <p>Scylla is an OSINT tool developed in Python 3.6. Scylla lets users perform advanced searches on Instagram & Twitter accounts, websites/webservers, phone numbers, and names. 
                Scylla also allows users to find all social media profiles (main platforms) assigned to a certain username. 
                In continuation, Scylla has shodan support so you can search for devices all over the internet, it also has in-depth geolocation capabilities. 
                Lastly, Scylla has a finance section which allows users to check if a credit/debit card number has been leaked/pasted in a breach and returns 
                information on the cards IIN/BIN.</p>

            <h2><i>ThreadBoat</i></h2>
            <h3>Program Uses Thread Execution Hijacking To Inject Native Shell-code Into a Standard Win32 Application.</h3>
            <p>I developed this small project to continue my experiences of different code injection methods and to allow RedTeam security professionals to 
                utilize this method as a unique way to perform software penetration testing. With Thread hijacking, it allows the hijacker.exe program to susepend a thread within the target.exe program allowing us to write shellcode to that target thread, 
                and later be executed (via; WriteProcessMemory(), SetThreadContext(), ResumeThread(), CreateThread()).</p>

            <h3>Hides Process From Task Manager Using NT API Hooking (NtQuerySystemInformation).</h3>
            <p> - Hook the API function NtQuerySystemInformation() with our own function that hides a process from task manager.<br/>
                - Hooked function gets called instead.<br/>
                - The DLL is injected into Taskmgr.exe so there is a virtual memory space available to execute our hooked code.</p>

                <h3><i>Programmatically Combatting Pseudorandom Number Generators With Uniform Integer Distributions: A Modern C++ Approach</i></h3>
                <p>Abstract: Pseudorandom Number Generators come as a great assistance to programmers. 
                    Although, they come with a great deal of security flaws as they
                    do not truly generate a “random” sequence of numbers. The C++ Standard
                    Template Library provides a solution to this problem as programmers can
                    now implement more secure seed-able random number generators to provide a proper integer distribution of non-deterministic random values, to
                    better support their programming practices.</p>

                <p>Abstract: It seems like right when you turn on your PC, magic happens. It’s almost like regular users believe anything below high-level software programs is almost impossible to comprehend. 
                    However, that’s not the case and I believe it’s crucial for a programmer to understand the levels of computing from the hardware all the way up to everyday programs.</p>

                <h3><i>Intercepting Network Traffic With The Espionage Packet Sniffer</i></h3>
                <p>Abstract: The practice of packet sniffing has been around since the late 1980s. It has been used widely throughout the cybersecurity community and it serves many purposes. First, I think we should cover what it really is. 
                    According to paessler.com, it is defined as the practice of gathering, collecting, 
                    and logging some or all packets that pass through a computer network, regardless of how the packet is addressed.</p>
